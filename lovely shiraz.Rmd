With the aim of creating a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet as week 2 assignment I will introduce you my lovely city "Shiraz" in the interactive map that shows its location.

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
shiraz <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=29.61462461898951, lng=52.54778869912209, popup = "lovely city")

shiraz
```
